Submitting a Plugin

 This document describes the steps for submitting a plugin to the Mojo project. These steps might not apply to
 everyone, but should be a general guideline.

 Subscribe to the {{{../mail-lists.html}developer mailing list}} and ask if there is an interest in the plugin. If there
 is an interest, package the plugin in a tarball or a zip file, create an issue for the component "Plugin Submission"
 in our {{{../issue-tracking.html}issue tracker}} and attach the source code
 there. Make sure that you try to follow our {{{../development/guidelines.html}development guidelines}}.

 Once accepted it will be put in the sandbox so all mojo-committers can continue to develop and maintain it. A new Mojo component will
 be added in {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MOJO}Jira}} so everybody can create issues and provide patches. The plugin will
 generally be kept in the sandbox until the first release of the plugin is made.

 Note that you will not automatically become a committer on the project. If you stick around and keep on maintaining
 the plugin we'll most likely grant you commit rights once we feel comfortable with you and your work.
