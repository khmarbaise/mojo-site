Development Process

 * Anyone can start a plugin in the sandbox at any time.

 * Once in a fairly useable state, the plugin should be listed on the sandbox section of the mojo site and snapshots be deployed. If no site is available, try to at least post a link to the SVN location. This advertises the existence of the plugin, which will hopefully generate more interest and developers.

 * Deploying snapshots lowers the bar to entrance for potential users.

 * Plugins on the website should gather people willing to work on them. We hope at least 2 people will know how an
 individual plugin works.

* {Versioning and Release Strategy}

 We follow the versioning from Maven itself:

 [x.y.z-alpha-n] Alpha version, not feature complete.

 [x.y.z-beta-n] Beta version, complete for the next release, not fully tested/documented.

 [x.y.z] "Proper" release.

 []

 Where:

 * x is the major version: updated when it is not backwards compatible with the previous version.

 * y is the minor version: updated when features are added.

 * z is the micro version: service release, only bugfixes.

 []

 Plugins can have snapshot versions deployed for testing, or beta/alpha releases deployed for wider testing and a bit more stability.
 All releases deployed to the Codehaus repository are synced to the Central Repository. Sandbox plugins should only use snapshot versions.
 
 Once a plugin is ready for another release or is about to graduate from the sandbox, follow the checklist for
 {{{./performing-a-release.html}performing a release}}.

* {Debugging Tips}

 To debug Maven 2/3 with IDEA use this command:

+-----+
MAVEN_OPTS="-Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005" 
mvn install
+-----+


* {Applying patches}

  With git-svn more and more patches are contributed in a format you can't directly apply on our svn repository.
  For most of the operating systems there's a program called <<<patch>>> available, but not for Windows. 
  Probably the easiest way for Windows users is to install {{{http://www.cygwin.com/}CygWin}} and put the <<<%CYGWIN_HOME%\\bin>>> on their <<<Path>>>.
  
  To be able to apply patches run:
  
+---
patch -p1 < bugfix.patch
+---
